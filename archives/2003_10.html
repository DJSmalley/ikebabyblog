<h3 class="title">Isaac & Alex</h3>

<p>Our good friends Karin & Jim Foss just had their second son, Alexander, on September 30th.  Here he's not even 24 hours old (but he's very, very cute).<br />
It's amazing how much babies grow in four months.  I can't remember when Ike was that small (and quiet)!<br />

<p>This is one of the last times we were able to use this car seat because Ike is SO DARN HUGE.  We had to upgrade to a bigger one about four months earlier than we thought we'd have to.<br />

<p>We started feeding him rice cereal for the first time on Saturday.  You can tell he's still a bit unsure about this whole solid food thing.<br />

<h3 class="title">New Tricks (3 pictures)</h3>

<p>He's figuring out how to hold the bottle himself -- he loves yanking it out of his mouth and shoving it back in.  This is very impressive, but it gets ever-so-slightly annoying when he's done it 50 times in a row and one feeding takes half an hour.<br />
<img alt="031015b.jpg" src="../archives/031015b.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="308" /><br />
Even his <i>back </i>is cute.  He's getting pretty good at rolling from his back to his stomach, but once he's face down he has no idea what to do and freaks out a little bit.  His new favorite sleeping position is on his right side--just like his mom.<br />
<img alt="031015c.jpg" src="../archives/031015c.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="219" /><br />
This picture was taken when Isaac and Doug were playing before bedtime.  The best part about it--besides Isaac's gorgeous face--is the noises Doug was making in order to entertain Ike.<br />

<h3 class="title">Another New Trick</h3>

<p>Ike sat by himself for a few seconds this afternoon--he figured out how to prop himself up with his hands.  You might also notice he's drooling a bit these days.<br />

<h3 class="title">So sorry...</h3>

<p>I know, I know -- we've already broken our promise to update this site "every couple of days".  But we were in Iowa for a UU conference, then Doug left for San Diego, and then my back went out.  This is the most I've been out of bed in two days (and my back is screaming at me to return to a horizontal position).  More pictures of Ike will be posted soon, I swear.</p>

<p>But for now, I just need to send a huge, huge, HUGE public thank you to my mom, who has been Isaac's primary care giver for the past 48 hours.  Although it has been incredibly emotionally painful for me not to be able to hold him due to my #@%& back, it has been pretty darn fun to hear them playing together for hours on end.  Thanks, Mom!</p>

<h3 class="title">Greetings from IMax himself</h3>

<p>Isaac wanted to make his own posting today.  Here's what he "typed" while sitting on Doug's lap in front of the computer -- we're a little worried about the subliminal racist plug:</p>

<p>Grandpa Clay is in town visiting from Houston.  We spent the day at Aunt Michele & Uncle Doug's house. <br />

Grandpa was trying to watch the Vikings game, but Ike wouldn't give up his glasses.<br />

Aunt Michele took Ike for a walk through the house.  He especially liked Uncle Doug's neon beer sign collection.<br />

<h3 class="title">Welcome to the World, Jack! (3 pictures)</h3>

<p>Isaac has graciously agreed to take second stage today so his brand-new, 12-hour-old cousin can take the lime light.  At 9:22 a.m. Atlanta time, Doug's sister, Sarah, gave birth to a healthy, happy, wonderfully perfect baby boy.<br />
<img alt="031027a.JPG" src="../archives/031027a.JPG" width="400" height="300" border="0" /><br />
He weighed in at 9 lbs., 2 oz., same as Ike did at birth.  His name is Kedrik (after his dad) Jackson (after Doug and Sarah's grandpa) Merwin.  He'll be called Jack.  The whole family, including big sisters Madeline and Chloe, are doing well. <br />
<img alt="031027c.JPG" src="../archives/031027c.JPG" width="400" height="300" border="0" /> <br />
In honor of Jack's birthday, we're throwing in an older family photo -- from July 4th weekend when Ike was just one month old (he's so tiny!).  Jack's sisters are in the ever-so-cute flag swimsuits; Jack's mom is holding Chloe in the front row; Jack's dad is in the gray t-shirt. <br />
<img alt="DSCF0093_edited.JPG" src="../archives/DSCF0093_edited.JPG" border="0" width="400" height="292" /><br />
WELCOME TO OUR FAMILY, JACK!  WE CAN'T WAIT TO MEET YOU!</p>

<p>Tonight Grandpa Clay took us and Doug's Aunt Linda (see picture below) to the Shania Twain concert in St. Paul.  Isaac was disappointed he couldn't come along, but Grandma came over and he soon forgot all about us.<br />
<img alt="031028a.jpg" src="../archives/031028a.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="0" /><br />
We also gave Grandpa and Aunt Linda a special sneak preview of Ike's Halloween costume -- ain't he precious???<br />
