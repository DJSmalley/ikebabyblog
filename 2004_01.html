<h3 class="title">7 Months Old!</h3>

<p>It's getting much harder to take these monthly pictures of Isaac.  He would rather launch himself off the couch than sit still and smile for the camera.  This was the only picture we got of his face -- he turned his head away from the camera at the last second for the rest of them.  What a (really energetic) cutie.<br />

<h3 class="title">Ho Hum ...</h3>

<p>Isaac has been getting bored more often recently.  Gone are the days where he was content to sit and stare at a wall.  A week ago these were his favorite toys; now, as you can see, he is quite indifferent towards them.  This increased curiosity for all things novel is exciting for him, but draining for us.<br />

<h3 class="title">A Tooth!</h3>

<p>No picture yet, but we had to report that Isaac's first tooth broke the surface today.  It is the lower right front one, and it is very sharp and very, very cute.</p>

<h3 class="title">Practicing 'Round the Clock</h3>

<p>In his ever-vigilant quest to figure out how to crawl, Isaac has been practicing <i>constantly</i>--even in his sleep.  He pushes himself up onto his hands and knees every time he rolls over on to his stomach, so at 2 a.m. (and 4 a.m., and 6 a.m. ...) he's up on all fours, rocking back and forth, getting more and more excited every second.  This wouldn't be a problem, except he can't go back to sleep until one of us gets out of bed and helps him roll back over.  What will it be like when he's learning how to walk?!<br />

<h3 class="title">Splish-Splash</h3>

<p>Isaac is starting to love bath time.  He splashes with wild abandon and screeches every once in a while when the excitement is just too much for him to contain.<br />

<h3 class="title">UltraSaucer ShumltraSaucer</h3>

<p>Sadly, Ike outgrew his "UltraSaucer".  This put us in a bit of a crisis since it was a wonderful way for him to burn off energy without tipping over any of our glass shelving (ok, so the house isn't QUITE baby-proofed).  We bought this "Jumperoo" as a replacement.  Judging by this picture, it pleases him.</p>

<h3 class="title">BabySafe Feeder</h3>

<p>This mesh feeder is supposed to encourage babies to feed themselves.  It's not working for Isaac.  He loves eating out of it, but only if we put it in his mouth for him.  It's the one thing in the house his hands won't go near.  Odd.<br />
